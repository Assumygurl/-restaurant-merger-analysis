🚀 Excited to share my first end-to-end data analytics portfolio project!

I built a complete restaurant chain merger analysis platform for ABC & XYZ restaurants — from raw Excel files all the way to an AI-powered interactive dashboard and automated reports.

Here's what I built:

📊 Data Pipeline — cleaned and merged 40,000 transaction records across 544 restaurant locations using Python and Pandas

🗄️ SQL Database — designed and loaded a relational SQLite database with 4 tables (orders, restaurants, products, customers)

📈 10+ Visualizations — spending trends by season, gender, region, time of day, and purchase method

📝 Automated Word Report — Python script that pulls live data from the database and generates a fully formatted professional report

📊 19-Slide PowerPoint — auto-generated presentation covering current state analysis, stakeholder recommendations, and a 3-year strategic plan

🤖 Live Interactive Dashboard — built with Streamlit and Plotly with 4 pages, live filters, and a natural language AI query feature

🔮 Revenue Forecasting — used Facebook Prophet ML model to forecast 12 months of future revenue with 95% confidence intervals

💡 Key Findings:
✅ Combined revenue of $161M across 2024-2025
✅ Pizza and Salads are the most profitable categories
✅ Florida generates 21% of total profit alone
✅ Spring drives $105M in revenue — Fall only $4M
✅ Identified and documented critical data quality issues in both datasets

🛠️ Tools used: Python | SQLite | Pandas | Streamlit | Plotly | Prophet | python-docx | PptxGenJS

This project taught me that data analytics isn't just about charts — it's about telling a story that helps leadership make better decisions.
