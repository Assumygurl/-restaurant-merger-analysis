🧵 I just finished my first data analytics portfolio project and I'm so proud of it!

I built an end-to-end restaurant chain merger analysis platform using Python, SQL, Streamlit and machine learning.

Here's everything I built in one thread 👇

📊 The Problem:
Two restaurant chains (ABC & XYZ) just merged.

Leadership needs a 3-year plan but the data is messy, inconsistent and spread across two Excel files.

My job: clean it, analyse it, and tell the story.

40,000 transactions. 544 locations. 48 states. Let's go 🔥

🧹 Step 1 — Data Cleaning

Found these issues in the raw data:
❌ 1,952 corrupted dates in ABC (9.76% of data)
❌ 100% null cost column in XYZ
❌ Inconsistent category names across both files

Fixed everything with Python and documented every change.

Clean data = trustworthy analysis ✅

📈 Step 2 — Key Findings

After cleaning and analysing 40,000 records:

🏆 Pizza = most profitable category ($33M)
🌍 Florida alone = 21% of total profit
🌸 Spring = $105M revenue | Fall = only $4M
🚗 Carry Out = most popular purchase method
👩 Female customers = higher avg order value

✅ Live filters by chain, season, gender
✅ Natural language query feature
✅ Plotly interactive charts

Type a question → get data + chart instantly 🚀

🔮 Step 4 — Revenue Forecasting

Used Facebook Prophet ML model to forecast the next 12 months of revenue.

Spring 2026 projected as peak season.

This is what leadership needs for the 3-year plan 📊
